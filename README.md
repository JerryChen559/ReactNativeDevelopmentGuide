#### COMPONENTS
Native, not web components e.g. <view> not <div>

Building blocks of React Native app

Has JSX, props and state

https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/components-and-apis.html 

#### JSX
Write markup language in the codebase

Syntax for embedding XML within JavaScript e.g. <Text>Hello world!</Text>

https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html 

#### PROPS
Set by the parent

Fixed throughout lifetime of the app

Creation parameters customize components

https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/props.html 

#### STATE
Track data changes in app

Init in constructor, then call setState to update 

Changes in state trigger RN lifecycle e.g. render() to run again

https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/state.html

#### UPGRADING BUILDS
Currently updates once a month

DO NOT recommend upgrading immediately unless read the release notes and are willing to break a project build. There are typically unforeseen issues with dependencies and 3rd party libraries.

DO recommend upgrading immediately if you want to help stabilize the build by reporting bugs and collaborating with the community to create patches. The core team canâ€™t test everything. Why not help fix it?
