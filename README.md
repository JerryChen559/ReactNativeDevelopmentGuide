#### REACT
- [React docs](https://reactjs.org/)

#### COMPONENTS
- Native, not web components e.g. <view> not <div>

- Building blocks of React Native app

- Has JSX, props and state

- [Components and APIs - React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/components-and-apis.html) 

#### JSX
- Write markup language in the codebase

- Syntax for embedding XML within JavaScript e.g. <Text>Hello world!</Text>

- [JSX in Depth - React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) 

#### PROPS
- Set by the parent

- Fixed throughout lifetime of the app

- Creation parameters customize components

- [Props - React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/props.html) 

#### STATE
- Track data changes in app

- Init in constructor, then call setState to update 

- Changes in state trigger RN lifecycle e.g. render() to run again

- [State - React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/state.html)

- Note: Caches increase loading times, but may need to be deleted to process project updates. For changes to core app settings like app icon and splash screens, make sure to clear Derived Data in Xcode. iOS Emulators should be reset or uninstall the app. Android emulators also need to be reset as well for updates to app icons/splash screens.

#### UPGRADING BUILDS
- Currently updates once a month

- DO NOT recommend upgrading immediately unless read the release notes and are willing to break a project build. There are typically unforeseen issues with dependencies and 3rd party libraries.

- DO recommend upgrading immediately if you want to help stabilize the build by reporting bugs and collaborating with the community to create patches. The core team canâ€™t test everything. Why not help fix it?
